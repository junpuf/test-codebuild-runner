Junpu: can you write a new poem about GitHub Actions, and talking about how great it is?

AI Chatbot:

"The Automation Symphony"

In the world of code and might, GitHub Actions shine so bright, Push commits and watch them soar, Through pipelines we can't ignore.

Tests are running, builds compile, Making every change worthwhile, Matrix jobs spread far and wide, Quality gates open wide.

YAML flows like poetry, Setting automations free, Caching speeds up every run, Till the final check is done.

Containers spin up with grace, In this cloud-computed space, Integration smooth and clean, Building dreams we've never seen.

From testing code to artifact, Each workflow precisely craft, Making software better each day, As Actions light up the way.
