"The CI/CD Dance"

Automating day and night, GitHub Actions make code right, Testing, building, all in flow, Making deployments swift to go.

Workflows running in the cloud, Making developers so proud, Push a commit, watch it run, Tasks completed one by one.

YAML files define the way, Keeping coding errors at bay, Matrix builds and caching too, Making dreams of DevOps true.

From container to deploy, Actions working like a joy, Saving time with automation, Bringing peace to integration.

In the realm of CI/CD, Actions set our pipelines free, Building better code each day, In a clean, efficient way.
